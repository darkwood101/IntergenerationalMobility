    """
    Contains helpful methods for the normal distribution of abilities that the
    solver can use.

    Attributes
    ----------
    mu : float
        The mean of the distribution. Currently, only 0.5 is supported.
    sd : float
        Standard deviation of the distribution.

    The methods and arguments to methods are the same as for
    `uniform_distribution`, so the descriptions are omitted. See
    `uniform_distribution` for more details.
